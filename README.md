# Anti-Phishing-Bot
A Discord bot that deletes phishing links from all text channels. It checks for new links every 5 hours from [Nikolaischunk's phishing link github](https://github.com/nikolaischunk/discord-phishing-links) and stores them in the 'domains.json' file.

# Config
Make sure you have the required libraries installed by running 'python -m pip install discord' and 'python -m pip install colorama'.
Edit the 'main.py' file and put your bot token on line 5 and everything is finished.
